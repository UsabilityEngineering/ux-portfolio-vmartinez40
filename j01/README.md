# Chefman Air Fryer 
### by Victor Martinez 10/14/22

Growing up without a microwave, the idea of an air fryer was foreign to me. I have only ever practiced cooking on a stove top. The way the air fryer works is a fan circulates hot air at high speed, producing a crisp layer via browning reactions such as the [Maillard reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction). My overall goal for this is to make tasty food without over or under-cooking the food.

On first glance, there are two main knobs: the temperature knob up top and the timer knob in the middle of the air fryer. While also including two indicator lights, the one on the left tells you it is on, and the one on the right lets you know the appliance is heating up. This made for a **memorable** design aspect since the lights provide immediate feedback for me to know when the air fryer is ready. For my first trial, I tried frying some eggs. At first, I had no idea for how long or what temperature to set the air fryer to. As a leap of faith, I tried 350F for 10 minutes. While removing the tray, cracking two eggs, and seasoning with salt and pepper before hand. 

Once I hit the 5 minute mark, I decided to check the eggs, and they looked a little runny, so I decided to leave it in for another 3 minutes. In the end, I did not achieve over hard eggs on final inspection. I did achieve my goal of making tasty eggs without burning or undercooking the eggs. For another trial I may cook meats/protien, but cooking meats like chicken or steak can be stressful because of the varying cooking temperatures and times.Â
