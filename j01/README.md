# Chefman Air Fryer 
### by Victor Martinez 10/14/22

Growing up without a microwave, the idea of an air fryer was foreign to me. I have only ever practiced cooking on a stove top. The way the air fryer works is, a fan circulates hot air at high speed, producing a crisp layer via browning reactions such as the [Maillard reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction). My overall goal for this is to make tasty food without over or under-cooking the food.

On first glance there are two main knobs, the temperature knob up top, and the timer knob in the middle of the air fryer. While also including two inicator lights, the one on the left telling you its on, and the one on the right letting you know the appliance is heating. For my first trial I tried frying some eggs. At first I had no idea for how long or what temperature to set the air fryer to. So as a leap of faith I tried 350F for 10 minutes. While before hand removing the tray, cracking two eggs, and seasoning with salt and pepper.

Once hitting the 5 minute mark I decided to check the eggs and they looked a little runny so I decided to leave it in for another 3 minutes. On final inspection while I did not achieve over hard eggs. I did achieve my goal of making tasty eggs without burning or undercooking the eggs. I feel cooking meats like chicken or steak may become stressful due in fact to varying cooking temps and times.
